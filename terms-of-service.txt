Terms of Service
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in VRChat Inc. (“VRChat,” “we,” or “us”) and our website at www.vrchat.com, along with our related websites, networks, desktop applications (each, a “Desktop Client”), VR headset applications (each, a “VR Client”), software development kits for use in connection with any technology or services made available by or on behalf of VRChat (each, an “SDK”), and other services provided by us (collectively, including any Clients (defined below) and SDKs, the “Platform”). This VRChat Terms of Use (this “TOU”), is a legally binding contract between you and VRChat regarding your use of the Platform.  
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY USING THE PLATFORM OR ANY PART OF THE PLATFORM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS TOU. If you are not eligible, or do not agree to this TOU, then you do not have our permission to use the Platform or any part of the Platform.
You acknowledge and agree that, as provided in greater detail in this TOU:
•any Client is licensed, not sold to you;
•you may use the Platform only as set forth in this TOU;
•the Platform is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind and VRChat’s liability to you is limited;
•disputes arising under this TOU will be resolved by binding arbitration, and by accepting this TOU, as described in greater detail in Section 26, you and VRChat are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
1. Platform Overview
VRChat is a platform for experiencing, creating, and publishing social virtual reality experiences. Users can create, share, and interact with virtual worlds and avatars.
2. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Platform. By agreeing to this TOU, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Platform; and (c) your registration and your use of the Platform complies with all applicable laws and regulations. If you are at least 13 but are under the age of 18, you may only use the Platform with your parent’s or guardian’s consent and your parent or guardian must provide consent after having read this TOU. In such a case you represent and warrant and covenant that both you and your parent or guardian have read and consent to this TOU (including all the conditions, limitations, disclaimers, and waivers provided herein). You further acknowledge and agree that by using the Platform you are accepting a benefit that you cannot return or disgorge and that we are relying on your representations regarding your ability to accept and perform this TOU, and you therefore waive any right you may have under applicable law to void, rescind, or otherwise avoid this TOU. If you are a parent or guardian consenting to this TOU on behalf of a child between the ages of 13 and 18, you additionally agree to guarantee and be fully responsible for that person’s performance hereunder, including all financial obligations or liability he or she may incur, and all disclaimers and waivers of applicable legal protections provided herein, and you agree to take all actions (including executing such additional documents or agreements) necessary to effect and perfect the foregoing. In all other cases, you represent that you are 18 years or older and fully competent to enter into this TOU, and you hereby agree and acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this TOU without modification.  
If you are using the Platform on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this TOU and you agree to be bound by this TOU on behalf of that organization.  
You further represent and warrant that you are not listed on or covered by any sanctioned person lists administered by the United States government or United Nations, including but not limited to the United States Department of Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, the United States Department of Commerce’s List of Denied Persons or Entity List, and the United Nations Security Council Sanctions. You further represent that you are not located in a country subject to comprehensive United States sanctions, including Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea, or the Crimea region of Ukraine. Should you become listed on or otherwise subject to any such list or are in a country subject to comprehensive United States sanctions, then you agree to immediately cease use of the Platform.
3. Accounts and Registration
To access most features of the Platform, you must register for an account (your “User Account”). When you register, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your email address or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password.   
You may also access certain features of the Platform using your login credentials for third-party accounts, such as your account with Steam, Facebook/Oculus, or HTC/Viveport (each a “Third-Party Account”). The Platform may offer functionality allowing you to merge your User Account with a Third-Party Account.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password(s) for your User Account and any Third-Party Accounts, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your User Account. If you have reason to believe that your User Account or Third-Party Platform Account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at support@vrchat.com.  
4. Client Licenses
Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions in this TOU, VRChat grants you a limited, non-commercial (except as otherwise specified in this TOU or other written agreement between you and VRChat), non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to each copy of any Desktop Client or VR Client (each, a “Client”) downloaded directly from VRChat’s website or from a legitimate marketplace (such as the Oculus, Steam, or Viveport Store), solely in an executable application format, for your personal use for lawful purposes, on a single compatible device you own or control, and to access and use the Platform in accordance with this TOU. The terms “Desktop Client” and “VR Client,” as used in this TOU, include any updates or modifications to the applicable Client made available to you by or on behalf of VRChat (unless provided with separate terms, in which case those terms are hereby incorporated into this TOU unless otherwise stated in those separate terms).
5. VRChat SDK License
Your use of any SDK is subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions in this TOU and the SDK terms applicable to the SDK (which are incorporated into this TOU by this reference). If no other SDK license terms are distributed in connection with a particular SDK, then your use of that SDK is subject to the SDK license available at https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/sdk (the “SDK License”).
6. Trademark License
Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with this TOU, VRChat grants you a limited, non-commercial (except as otherwise specified in this TOU or other written agreement between you and VRChat), non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use its trade names, trademarks, service names, and service marks (“Marks”), solely when used in compliance with the then-current VRChat brand guidelines (or any successor URL designated by VRChat) (the “Brand Guidelines”), and solely in connection with permitted uses under this TOU. The Brand Guidelines are incorporated into this TOU by this reference. Any goodwill in the Marks will inure solely to VRChat.
7. No Support
We are under no obligation to provide support for the Platform. In instances where we may offer support, the support will be subject to applicable published policies.
8. Payment
8.1. Payments Generally. Access to the Platform, or to certain features of the Platform, may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. Purchases made through third-party markets, such as Steam and Facebook, may be governed by additional terms provided by such third-party markets. If VRChat changes the fees for any part of the Platform, including by adding additional fees or charges, VRChat will provide you advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, VRChat may discontinue providing the Platform or applicable portion of the Platform to you. VRChat will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. You authorize VRChat to charge all sums as described in this TOU to that payment method. If you pay any fees with a credit card, VRChat may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. If you use the Platform to update or cancel any existing authorized payment, it may take up to 10 business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.
8.2. Subscription Service. Certain premium features on the Platform may be made available through purchase of a subscription (“Subscription Service”). Subscription Services involve automatically recurring payments for periodic charges and may be purchased through a third-party market. If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize VRChat (or the applicable third-party market) to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums for your subscription to the Subscription Service on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you first purchase a subscription to a Subscription Service. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date for all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period. Your subscription to the Subscription Service will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription to a Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fee to your account. We (or the applicable third-party market) will bill the periodic subscription fee to the payment method you provide during purchase (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). We may suspend or terminate access to a Subscription Service for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for any Subscription Service, a delinquent account may be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees. In the event that an account is moderated for violation of this TOU, any ongoing Subscription Service associated with the account may be cancelled, provided that the then-current subscription period will continue. Payments for Subscription Services are non-refundable. If you have activated a Subscription Service through a third-party market, you may cancel your subscription to that Subscription Service through the third-party market’s account settings or other procedures established by that third-party market. If you have questions, please email us at support@vrchat.com. The following links may be helpful in connection with managing your subscription through third-party markets (but may not include all Platform subscription options):

9. User Content
9.1. User Content Generally. Certain features of the Platform may permit users to upload content to the Platform, including software code, messages, photos, video, images, folders, data, text, and other types of works (“User Content”) and to publish User Content on the Platform. You retain copyright and any other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content you post to the Platform.
9.2. Limited License Grant to VRChat. By posting, publishing, or otherwise developing User Content in the Platform, you grant VRChat a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels now known or hereafter developed. You agree that the license granted to VRChat under this Section 9.2 applies to any User Content you previously posted, published, or otherwise developed in the Platform.
 9.3. Limited License Grant to Other Users. By posting or sharing User Content with other users of the Platform in a public portion of the Platform, or by setting any of your User Content to public, you grant those users a non-exclusive license to access and use that User Content as permitted by this TOU and the functionality of the Platform.
9.4. User Content Representations and Warranties. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing User Content. By posting or publishing User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:  
a. you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize VRChat and users of the Platform to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this section, in the manner contemplated by VRChat, the Platform, and this TOU;  
b. your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by this TOU, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause VRChat to violate any law or regulation; and
c. your User Content could not be deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.
 9.5. Deleting User Content  
a. Where permitted, you may delete copies or instances of your User Content that you have uploaded to your account through the normal functionality of the Platform. If you delete your User Content through use of that functionality, the licenses granted by you in this Section 9 to your User Content terminate as described in this Section 9.5 with respect to the particular copies or instances of your User Content that you have deleted. 
b. The termination of the licenses does not apply to any copies or instances of the same User Content that you have not specifically deleted from the Platform, including those that may be displayed elsewhere or that may be stored by other users to whom you transferred copies.  
c. The licenses under this Section 9 that you granted to your User Content that you have deleted through the Platform will survive termination solely to allow VRChat to: (i) retain server copies of particular instances of your User Content, including copies stored in connection with back-up, debugging, and testing procedures; and (ii) enable the exercise of the licenses granted in this Section 9 for any other copies or instances of the same User Content that you have not specifically deleted from the Platform, including those that may be displayed elsewhere or that exist in other users’ account inventories.
9.6. User Content Disclaimer. We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. VRChat may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates this TOU or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that, when using the Platform, you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Most User Content, including worlds and avatars, available through VRChat is created by other users or third parties, and VRChat does not control or actively monitor the content or technical features of individual worlds, avatars, or other User Content. You understand that any world you enter is at your own risk. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against VRChat with respect to User Content. We expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to this TOU, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, VRChat does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Platform.
10. Digital Millennium Copyright Act
We comply with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. §512, as amended). Please review our copyright policy available at https://hello.vrchat.com/copyright (the “Copyright Policy”). The Copyright Policy is incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, this TOU.

Access to the Platform from countries or territories or by individuals where such access is illegal is prohibited. Nothing in this Section 11 or in this TOU is intended to restrict users from streaming their use of the Platform through a third-party streaming platform, including Twitch and YouTube, provided that such use is in compliance with all other terms of this TOU, including the Brand Guidelines and in compliance with all applicable third-party terms relating to those third-party systems (such streaming, “Permitted Streaming”). This TOU does not prohibit you from monetizing such streaming through third-party streaming platforms’ authorized monetization systems. Your use of any third-party streaming platform is subject to that platform’s terms.

By using one of these tools, you agree that we may transfer that information to the applicable third-party service. Third-party services are not under our control, and we are not responsible for any third-party service’s use of your exported information. The Platform may also contain links to third-party websites.

21. Disclaimers; No Warranties
ALL PARTS OF THE PLATFORM AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE VRCHAT ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE PLATFORM AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING: (a) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND (b) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE VRCHAT ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE PLATFORM OR ANY PORTION OF THE PLATFORM, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE PLATFORM, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. VRCHAT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OR FUNCTIONALITY OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY, VALIDITY, OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION OR FEATURES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM, OR THE QUALITY OR CONSISTENCY OF THE PLATFORM. VRCHAT FURTHER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY RELATED TO YOUR CARRIER’S NETWORK OR SERVICE.  
NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE PLATFORM OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE VRCHAT ENTITIES OR THE PLATFORM THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS TOU. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM, YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER USER, AND ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE PLATFORM, AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR CONTENT THROUGH THE PLATFORM AND ANY ASSOCIATED SITES OR PLATFORMS, AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLATFORM), OR THE LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE PLATFORM OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF THAT MATERIAL OR CONTENT.   
SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.
22. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL THE VRCHAT ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE PLATFORM OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THIS TOU (INCLUDING ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT), WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY VRCHAT ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE. 
EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 26.5.c, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE VRCHAT ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE PLATFORM OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS TOU, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (a) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO VRCHAT FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE PLATFORM IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT(S) OR CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO CLAIM OR (b) $100.  
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.   
EACH PROVISION OF THIS TOU THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THIS TOU. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS TOU. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 22 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
23. Third Party Disputes
VRCHAT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY CARRIER, SERVICE PROVIDER, OR ADVERTISER, AND ANY DISPUTE YOU HAVE WITH ANY CARRIER, SERVICE PROVIDER, ADVERTISER, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING ANY OTHER USER OF ANY PLATFORM, IS DIRECTLY BETWEEN YOU AND SUCH THIRD PARTY, AND YOU IRREVOCABLY RELEASE VRCHAT (AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND EMPLOYEES) FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542, WHICH SAYS: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
24. Governing Law
This TOU is governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this TOU, then you and VRChat agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco, California for the purpose of litigating any dispute. We operate the Platform primarily from the United States, and we make no representation that Materials included in the Platform are appropriate or available for use in other locations.
25. Miscellaneous
25.1. Your use of the Platform is subject to all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Platform or certain features of the Platform that we may post on or link to from any part of the Platform (the “Additional Terms”), such as additional license agreements for any downloadable Materials, an SDK, or rules that apply to particular features or content on the Platform, subject to Section 18 (Modification of this TOU). All Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, this TOU.
25.2. This TOU (which includes the Copyright Policy, the Privacy Policy, and, if applicable, the SDK License, any Additional Terms, and any Commercial Use Agreement between you and VRChat (collectively, the “Ancillary Agreements”)) is the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and VRChat regarding your use of the Platform.

25.4. You may not assign or transfer this TOU or your rights under this TOU, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign this TOU at any time without notice or consent.  
25.5. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this TOU, or any provision of this TOU, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.  
25.6. For purposes of this TOU, (a) the words “include,” “includes” and “including” will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”; (b) the words “such as”, “for example” “e.g.” and any derivatives of those words will mean by way of example and the items that follow these words will not be deemed an exhaustive list; (c) the word “or” is used in the inclusive sense of “and/or” and the terms “or,” “any,” and “either” are not exclusive; (d) the words “herein,” “hereof,” “hereby,” “hereto” and “hereunder” refer to this Agreement as a whole; (e) words denoting the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice-versa; and (f) whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. The headings set forth in this TOU are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision hereof. Unless otherwise specified, references to “$” and “dollars” are to the currency of the United States of America. Any law defined or referred to herein means such law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor laws.
25.7. If any part of this TOU is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
26. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration 
26.1. Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and VRChat in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and VRChat agree that every dispute arising in connection with this TOU will be resolved by binding confidential arbitration in English. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this TOU, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this TOU. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TOU, YOU AND VRCHAT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
 26.2. Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 26.1, nothing in this TOU will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.  
26.3. Opt-Out. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 26 within 30 days after the date that you agree to this TOU by sending a letter to VRChat Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 548 Market St., #93053 San Francisco, CA, 94104-5401, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Platform, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once VRChat receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 26 will be void and any action arising out of this TOU will be resolved as set forth in Section 24. The remaining provisions of this TOU will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.  
 26.4. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and VRChat will: (a) be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act; (b) be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this TOU; (c) be administered by the AAA; and (d) if an arbitration hearing is held, take place at a mutually-agreed location in San Francisco County, California. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting VRChat.
 26.5. Notice; Process  
 5.a.A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). VRChat’s address for Notice is: VRChat Inc., 548 Market St, #93053 San Francisco, CA, 94104-5401. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
5.b. The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or VRChat may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or VRChat must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  
5.c.If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, VRChat will pay you the highest of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by VRChat in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; and (iii) $1,000.
 26.6. Decision. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
26.7. No Class Actions. YOU AND VRCHAT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Furthermore, unless both you and VRChat agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
 26.8. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If VRChat makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to VRChat’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to VRChat’s address for Notice, in which case your account with VRChat will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
26.9. Enforceability. If Section 26.7 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 26 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24 will govern any action arising out of or related to this TOU.
